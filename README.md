Data and matlab code for paper "A System for Real-Time Syringe Classification and Volume Measurement Using a Combination of Image Processing and Artificial Neural Networks"

## Instructions
- `Main_Program.m` is the file to run the test
- Each `NeuralNetwork_xxml.m` file are the program to load the data and save the trained model
- Each `NeuralNetwork_xxml.net` are the trained model for each syringes

## Data
- `X`: length of the plunger in pixels
- `Y`: Target volume of the medicine inside syringe
